My personal website project.

I'm using this project as a way portray myself to potential employers as well as to record my journey through web development.

To do:

- instead of that techstack intro line - add hover pop ups of what each on is.
- use figma to prototype your app - you can transfer css straight from the site, not need for guessing
- add an always moving 'hire me banner'just under the navbar
- mobile view
- add slack chat and linkedin + github social media buttons.
- do react todo with usereducer.
- add that construction svg to projects you are working on atm.
- look at firebase for your SQL database storage options

**\* check for a click event outside of the div itself **

myRef = React.createRef();

<!-- const checkIfContains = e => {
    if (myRef.current.contains(e.target)) {
        doSomething();
    }
}

<div ref={myRef} onClick={checkIfContains} /> -->

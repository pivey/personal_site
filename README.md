My personal website project.

I'm using this project as a way portray myself to potential employers as well as to record my journey through web development.

To do:

1. deploy and link all projects in the 'projects' section.

- react tictactoe \*\*\* DONE
- Unsplash_image_gallery
- Music_events_aggregator
- React_world_clocks
- vanilla-JS-ToDo-list

2. add a blog section with relavent articles
3. add routing to blog page
4. add a contact section + comment section
5. add a scroll progress bar in the blog section
6. link slack to the app so you can be messaged directly
7. add all social media links with on click anmation on button click - slide out from the left.
8. document the project using 'JSdocs'
9. use couchDB or mongoDB as a database for the blog posts
10. scrollable timeline of your web development journey - moved to stockholm to start at salt - working at qyre on desktop app - next step ... (UI circle with line to next circle - like a historic timeline. )
